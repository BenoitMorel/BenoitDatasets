Analysis options:
  run mode: Bootstrapping
  start tree(s): 
  bootstrap replicates: 10
  random seed: 1
  tip-inner: OFF
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (LG4X) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.
