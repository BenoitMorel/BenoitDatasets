WARNING: This is a BETA release, please use at your own risk!

RAxML-NG was called as follows:

mpi-scheduler --bootstrap --msa ../BenoitDatasets/families/alesim_s20_f50_sites400_d1.0_l0.5_seed42/pargenes/parse_run/results/48_prunedfasta/48_prunedfasta.raxml.rba --blopt nr_safe --model GTR --prefix ../BenoitDatasets/families/alesim_s20_f50_sites400_d1.0_l0.5_seed42/pargenes/mlsearch_run/bootstraps/48_prunedfasta/48_prunedfasta_bs6 --threads 1 --seed 7 --bs-trees 10

Analysis options:
  run mode: Bootstrapping
  start tree(s): 
  bootstrap replicates: 10
  random seed: 7
  tip-inner: ON
  pattern compression: ON
  per-rate scalers: OFF
  site repeats: OFF
  branch lengths: linked (ML estimate, algorithm: NR-SAFE)
  SIMD kernels: AVX2
  parallelization: NONE/sequential

WARNING: The model you specified on the command line (GTR) will be ignored 
         since the binary MSA file already contains a model definition.
         If you want to change the model, please re-run RAxML-NG 
         with the original PHYLIP/FASTA alignment and --redo option.
